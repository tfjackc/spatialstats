## R Markdown
#Quick overview of the RMD file and how to code the file. 

The template we have provided contains several pieces of information. 

* The header (Lines 1 ~ 7) is where you should add a title, date, and your name as the author.
* Text Areas (white areas in this file) where to write about your results and findings.
* Chunks are places where to add R code (areas shown in grey).

#Quick tips to get you started
* to embed a chunk of R code chunk: R code should be written in the grey areas between the ''' and ''' symbols 
* the **Knit** button will generate a document that includes both the content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 
* '# in the R code section will ignore the text that follows the hashtag treating the text as a comment.

* Some chunk options
* {r, echo=TRUE} will include the r code into the output. If you do not want to include the r code then set {r, echo=TRUE}.
* {r, include = FALSE} prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
* {r, echo = FALSE} prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
* {r, message = FALSE} prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
* {r, warning = FALSE} prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
* {r, fig.cap = "..."} adds a caption to graphical results.
